# मौलिक

Maulik is an app that helps people learn about listed indigeneous language along with the associated
cultures and origing cirumstances.

Once you select the language you would like to explore, you would be greeted with knowledge of various
subject matters like literatures written in the langauge, digital media art forms like movies, songs,
Television series etc that would help further raise awareness about the language.

We intend to add further languages down the road and you can help us in achieving this goal by
contributing any help you could. or provide feedbacks to us regarding the experience within the app
itself.

The best fun thing in the app is to mess around the explore menu and look at heatmap that shows 
population distrubtion of native speakers of associated langauge. 
You may also find hidden infos like sciptures of the languages and supposed place of origin pointed out.
